# Ted-Talks-Views-Prediction-ML
TED Talks views prediction ML Project
The main objective is to build a predictive model, which could help in predicting the views of the videos uploaded on the TEDx website.

Here we have performed
XGB Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Extra tree regressor

Linear Regressor

By comparing all these models

Out of all these models XGBRegressor is the best performer in terms of MAE while SVR is the worst performer.

ExtraTreeregressor gets overfitted on default parameters.

In all the features speaker_1_avg_views is most important.
